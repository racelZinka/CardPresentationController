The Book of Enoch is divided into five main sections:

- The Book of the Watchers (1â36): This section tells the story of how some angels, called the Watchers, rebelled against God and descended to Earth to mate with human women, producing a race of giants called the Nephilim. Enoch is summoned by God to intercede on behalf of the Watchers, but he receives a message of judgment instead. He also sees a vision of the heavenly realms and the secrets of nature.
- The Book of Parables (37â71): This section contains three parables that describe the fate of the righteous and the wicked, the coming of the Messiah and his kingdom, and the final judgment and resurrection. Enoch is identified as the Son of Man, a title later applied to Jesus in the New Testament.
- The Book of Astronomical Writings (72â82): This section deals with various aspects of cosmology, such as the movements of the sun, moon, and stars, the calendar, and the seasons. It also includes a book attributed to Enoch's son Methuselah.
- The Book of Dream Visions (83â90): This section contains two visions that Enoch saw in his dreams. The first one depicts the history of Israel from the creation to the exile, using symbolic animals to represent different groups of people. The second one foretells the end times and the final victory of God over evil.
- The Epistle of Enoch (91â108): This section consists of various exhortations and warnings to Enoch's children and future generations, as well as some apocalyptic prophecies and esoteric teachings.

The Book of Enoch is a fascinating and influential work that reflects the beliefs and concerns of ancient Judaism in a period of great turmoil and change.
