3. Replace the original stronghold2.exe file with the cracked one. You might want to make a backup of the original file in case you want to restore it later.
4. Run the game as usual. You should be able to play without inserting the CD.

Note: Using a nocd crack might violate the terms of service of the game and could result in legal issues. Use it at your own risk and only for personal use. We do not condone piracy or illegal distribution of software.
  
Stronghold 2 Deluxe is a sequel to the original Stronghold game, released in 2005. It features improved graphics, new gameplay modes, and more options to customize your castle and army. You can choose to play as a lord or a king, and follow different historical campaigns or create your own scenarios. You can also play online with other players or against the AI.
 
The game requires a CD to run, which can be inconvenient if you lose or damage the disc, or if you want to play on multiple devices. A nocd crack can solve this problem by allowing you to launch the game without the CD. However, you should be careful when downloading and using a nocd crack, as it might contain viruses or malware that could harm your computer. You should also scan the file with an antivirus program before installing it.
 
Another drawback of using a nocd crack is that it might prevent you from updating the game or accessing some online features. The game developers might also detect that you are using a modified file and ban you from their servers or take legal action against you. Therefore, you should only use a nocd crack for personal and legitimate reasons, and not for pirating or sharing the game with others.
  
If you want to play Stronghold 2 Deluxe without a CD, you might also consider buying a digital copy of the game from an online platform such as Steam or GOG. These platforms allow you to download and install the game on your computer without needing a physical disc. You can also access other benefits such as cloud saves, achievements, and community features. You can find Stronghold 2 Deluxe on Steam here: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/40960/Stronghold\_2\_Steam\_Edition/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/40960/Stronghold_2_Steam_Edition/) and on GOG here: [https://www.gog.com/game/stronghold\_2](https://www.gog.com/game/stronghold_2)
 
Another option to play Stronghold 2 Deluxe without a CD is to use a virtual drive program such as Daemon Tools or PowerISO. These programs allow you to create and mount an image file of the game disc on your computer, which acts as a virtual CD. You can then run the game from the virtual drive without needing the actual disc. However, you should be aware that some games might not work with this method, and that you might still need the original disc for legal purposes.
 
In conclusion, there are several ways to play Stronghold 2 Deluxe without a CD, but each one has its own advantages and disadvantages. You should weigh the pros and cons of each method and decide which one suits your needs and preferences best. You should also respect the intellectual property rights of the game developers and publishers and not use any illegal or unethical means to obtain or distribute the game.
